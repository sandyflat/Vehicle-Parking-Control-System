The Vehicle Parking Management System is a Java-based software solution (mini-project) designed for various parking facilities, including malls,
hospitals, public parking spaces, and paid parking areas. This system efficiently manages parking slots for both two-wheelers and four-wheelers, 
automatically allocating and deallocating slots as needed. Access to the system is restricted to authorized personnel, such as admins or security guards, 
who can control it via unique login credentials. Essential settings like parking prices and thresholds are customizable by the parking place owner,
ensuring flexibility and adaptability. Customer information is securely stored in a MySQL database, facilitating personalized services such as discounts and priority access.
The system is developed using core Java, with Swing utilized for the graphical user interface (GUI).
